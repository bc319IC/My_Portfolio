## What I Do
- **Machine Learning**: Building machine learning models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as well as hyperparamter tuning and model evaluation.
- **Data Analytics and Visualisation**: Data Mining and Preprocessing followed by visualisation to uncover meaningful insights from raw data.

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming**: Python, SQL, C++, MATLAB, Julia, Lua, and Verilog  .
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Keras.
